This is the front page for an academic portfolio, outlining myself and the current research interests I'm involved in, as well as some future directions. 

Currently an MASc. Candidate at Ontario Tech University, and part of the Nuclear Fuels and Materials Group, being co-supervised by Dr. Bernie Fitzpatrick, and Dr. Markus Piro. My research area involves nuclear forensics, and the proof of concept of characterizing of uranium hexa-fluoride drums for future use in inspection purposes. The main purpose of the work is to use surface characterization, and calorimetry based techniques to identify if the forensic fingerprint on the oxide surface is significant enough to determine enrichment of the uranium held. The work is part of a larger project headed by Dr. Micheal Short at MIT, and the project is in collaboration with the Mesoscale Nuclear Materials Group of MIT.

Previous research areas include oxidation, and oxide buildup of various materials, as well as investigations into thermodynamic systems of molten salts. Previous works include one paper published in the Journal of Nuclear Materials, and a secondary paper currently in press with hopefully more to come in the future.
